# MrBottie
Mr. Bottie is a simple twitter bot that works with Markov Chains to produce tweets. The source of words for the tweets comes from Moby Dick, by Herman Melville. 

I'd like to give a huge thanks to Edwin Dalmaijer for providing the framework for the python script of which the markov chain is based. Fork him on GitHub @ https://github.com/esdalmaijer
